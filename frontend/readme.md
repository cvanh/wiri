# app
the app is build in react native and uses axios for http requests and async storage for storage of credentials and it used react-navigation for mvc functionability.

## setup
the setup is just like any other react native app. The node version is defined with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). If you dont use nvm you can see the current version in `.nvmrc`
